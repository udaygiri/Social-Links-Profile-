### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to structure a social links profile using HTML and style it with CSS. Here are some snippets of code I'm proud of:

```html
<div class="name">
  Udaygiri D. Aparnathi
</div>
```
```css
.link a {
  display: flex;
  width: 15rem; /* Adjust the width as needed */
  height: 1.4rem; /* Adjust the height as needed */
  padding: .5rem;
  border-radius: 10px;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: var(--grey);
  text-decoration: none;
  font-size: 14px;
  font-family: var(--fontf);
  font-weight: 600;
  color: var(--white);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to continue improving my skills in responsive design and CSS techniques.
